## Accommo-Venient üè†

    - an old group project from 2020,during my 2nd year 
      of college.
    - i think by then i had not joined github, so my way 
      of version management was zipping files and giving 
      the zipfile names a time and date so i can know 
      when i last did changes hahaüòÇ.
    - well to think it was in an optimistic way the same 
      way github handles repos, except its much more 
      efficient and does it in a distributed way.

    - arguably one of my most painful project (growth 
      pains) and best project in terms of experience, wow 
      and appreciation of development. This is where the 
      love for php, web development, design, css and 
      dynamic pages (using ajax) came from. 
    - we couldn't complete when it was time for 
      submission due to scope creep and the 
      sheer excitement of what we could do and how 
      awesome it was, all the things we could do, all 
      the functions we could add to make it cool.
    - For me personally it was like discovering a new 
      toy that could do all kinds of amazing stuff you 
      had not given thought to.

    - fast forward to 2023 and out of nostalgia this 
      project is still on my mind and ive decided to 
      upload it and add it to the list of projects on my 
      portfolio, showcasing where i came from and also a 
      good feel and boost of self confidence. i am proud 
      of this group project, i guess i really did come a 
      long way hehe.
    - will now deploy it and try not to change the 
      source code to keep it in its 'antiqued' state 
      unless necessary.
